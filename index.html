       <h2>My Life</h2>
       <p>I am an expat who had, during his life the chance to travel a lot and the chance to live in many countries. In fact I lived in the Netherlands, in France, in Belgium and in England. I had to travel and to move out this much because of the work of my dad. I think it was a real chance because it allowed me to discover many cultures. </p>

       <h2>My Studies</h2>
       <p>As said in the previous section I had the chance to live in many crountries and therefore learned many ways of studying. I made my kindergarten in the Netherlands, my elementary school in France, my middle school in Belgium (more precisly in Brussels), and my high school in England (London). Finally, I made a year in an engineer school in Compi√®gne, near Paris but I didn't like it and reoriented myself to study business . </p>

       <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
       <p>Like said at the top of the page, I really like to climb. In fact I started climbing in London, during my high school. I also really like to go out with my friends like a lot of students, I think. Finally, I just started to learn the Ukulele and hope to be better at the end of the year. </p>
